# About

This extension is a very simple companion to the existing password
manager. It simply provides the user with a context menu that they can
then use to fill in a form with previously-saved credentials.  This
extension is especially useful if you've set the
'signon.autofillForms' preference to false and wish to either: i)
populate a password-only form; or ii) populate a forms with
credentials different than those already pre-filled by the website.
